	 * You are playing the following Bulls and Cows game with your friend:
	 * You write a 4-digit secret number and ask your friend to guess it
	 * Each time your friend guesses a number, you give a hint
	 * The hint tells your friend how many digits are in the correct position (called "bulls")
	 * and how many digits are in the wrong positions (called "cows"
	 * Your friend will use those hints to find out the secret number
	 * Input:
	 * 1807
	 * 7801
	 * Output:
	 * 1 bull and 3 cows 
	 * Explanation:
	 * 1807 is the secret number
	 * 7810 is the guess
	 * The bull is the 8, the other 3 digits are cows
